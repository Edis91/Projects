    "# Finding non-English apps\n",
    "Since we are developers who target at making free apps for English users, we will have to remove the apps not intended for an English-speaking audience.\n",
    "To find apps that are not directed toward English-speaking users, we will look at the app names containing symbols/characters that are not commonly used in Enlgish text.\n",
    "To do this, we can look up the ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) for different characters. We know that the characters commonly used in English have an ASCII code in the range of 0 to 127. \n",
    "Luckily for us there is a function (ord) that takes a string as parameter, and gives us the ASCII code for that character.\n",
    "All we have to do is compare the chracter's ASCII code to determine whether an app is targeted for an English-speaking audience or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we create the function is_english(app_name), where:\n",
    "- The parameter **app_name** is a string coresponding to the name of the app\n",
    "- we iterate for each character in the string and check:\n",
    "    - The ASCII for the iterated characters\n",
    "    - If any of the characters ASCII is above 127 we return **False**, which indicates that the app is probably intended for a non-English speaking audience\n",
    "    - If all the characters have an ASCII of below 127, we return **True**, which indicates the app is probably intended for an English-speaking audience"

The same could not be said about games, since a game has usually has an end point, it can be finished, and at some point we get tired of playing the same games so we want to find new ones.

    "We earlier created a frequence table for genres at the App Store and will therefore highlight the genres which can be compared to the three categories in google play that are of interest. We find 13 genres that compare well with these three categories.\n",

    "- Entertainment : 6.069\n",
    "- PHOTOGRAPHY : 2.944\n",
    "- Video Players & Editors : 1.771\n",

    "For the highlighted genres in App Store, the most common one is **Entertainment**. A good idea could be to aim for this category/genre. If we want to succeed we should make apps that stand out from the rest of the entertainment apps. We see in the genre table above that **Entertainment:Education** looks like a relatively new area since it is the lowest common among the genres presented here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The runner-up category is **Photography** which also seems pretty popular in the App Store. Just as we specified with **entertainment**, the **Photography** apps will need to stand out, even more so than the entertainment ones because they are higher in number. A safe bet for now could be to therefore only focus on entertaining apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixing **entertainment** with **Photography** could be a way to create some interesting apps."
