    "# Determining optimal posting times for receiving highest number of comments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will look into posts at Hacker News (HN). We want to examine the data and answer a few questions, like:\n",
    "- Do posts aimed at asking Hacker News questions, receive more comments at average, than posts where the user wants to show Hacker News something they find intersting?\n",
    "- Do posts created at certain times recieve more comments on average for **ask hn** or **show hn** posts?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will sort the data between **ask hn** and **show hn** posts. calculate the average number of comments each category receives and focus on the more active category between **ask hn** and **show hn**. In the most active category, we will calculate the average number of comments received, per post and hour. We will then present the top 5 posting hours for receiving the most comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) consists of 20,000 rows and 7 columns that include information regarding:\n",
    "- **id**: The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "- **title**: The title of the post\n",
    "- **url**: The URL that the posts links to, if it the post has a URL\n",
    "- **num_points**: The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total    number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "- **num_comments**: The number of comments that were made on the post\n",
    "- **author**: The username of the person who submitted the post\n",
    "- **created_at**: The date and time at which the post was submitted\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we will open the **hacker_news.nsv** file, read it, and turn it into a list we store into the variable **hn**. We will then print the first 5 rows of the data set.\n"
